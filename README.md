Welcome to the Bomb Thrower Game! This Scratch project features a two-player game where players, represented by Red and Blue characters, aim to throw a bomb at each other to reduce their lifeline and emerge victorious before time runs out.

# Controls

    Player 1 (Red):
        Move using W (up), S (down), A (left), D (right) keys.
        Aim using 'O' (anti-clockwise) and 'P' (clockwise) keys.
        Release the bomb with the 'Space' key.

    Player 2 (Blue):
        Move using the Up (up), Down (down), Left (left), Right (right) keys.
        Aim using 'O' (anti-clockwise) and 'P' (clockwise) keys.
        Release the bomb with the 'Space' key.

# Game Mechanics

    Each player gets a turn for 15 seconds to make their move and throw the bomb.
    The damage inflicted by the bomb depends on two factors:
        -Direct touch with the bomb.
        -Proximity to the explosion.
